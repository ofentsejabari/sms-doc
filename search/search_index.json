When creating a subject, a user link it to a domain, provide a name and subject outline. In the current implementation, subject outline must accomadate all streams of the specified domain. Assignment of subject teachers is done at subject detailed view by a privileged user at school level. Add/ edit academic terms/ semesters Currently, the defined term applies to all domains. It assumes the start and end date of each academic term is the same for all domains. Add/ edit batches (intake) In every school, a batch is a collection of pupils who make up the foundation classes.
