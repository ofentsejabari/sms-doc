Features Create school profiles . Our system built on a multi-tenant architecture, allowing users to administer more than one school within the same or distinct domains. This feature makes it easy for administrators to define and manage school specific information as well as information/ data that applies to all schools under their administration. NOTE : Domain refers to either primary, junior or senior school in our context. Add/ edit domain specific subjects Subject are created by a privileged user at admin level. When creating a subject, a user link it to a domain, provide a name and subject outline. In the current implementation, subject outline must accomadate all streams of the specified domain. Assignment of subject teachers is done at subject detailed view by a privileged user at school level. Add/ edit academic terms/ semesters Currently, the defined term applies to all domains. It assumes the start and end date of each academic term is the same for all domains. Add/ edit batches (intake) In every school, a batch is a collection of pupils who make up the foundation classes. Base and subject classes are created by a user with specific privileges at school level. Students are enrolled to base classes during or after registration by editing student profile and updating base class field as depicted below. Enrolling students into subject classes is carried out at subject class details view. Only students taking that particular subject as an option, will be available for enrollment.i.e, student subject assignment must be done prior to this operation.","title":"School Admin"},{"location":"modules/school-admin/#school-administration","text":"","title":"School Administration"},{"location":"modules/school-admin/#introduction","text":"This is a core module that simulate the structures of host schools by defining and handling essential information needed to get the system up and running, as well as supporting other modules.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"modules/school-admin/#features","text":"","title":"Features"},{"location":"modules/school-admin/#create-school-profiles","text":"Our system built on a multi-tenant architecture, allowing users to administer more than one school within the same or distinct domains.

NOTE: System pre-defined authority-group names cannot be modified as they are treated as special names in the system. User Roles Create/ edit user roles - In the current version of the system, a user can only have one user role. User roles, on the other hand, are tied to numerous authority groups. System Users There are two kinds of personnel in the system and their user accounts are created with a somewhat different approaches: Creating users from the existing profiles, e.g. Teachers . Teachers profiles are created prior to their user accounts. Their profiles exists even if they do not have user accounts. Go to teacher profile then Actions -> Create user account to create their user account. The email account provide when creating teacher profile will be used as the username.
