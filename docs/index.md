# Overview

Technology plays an important role in streamlining education system in todayâ€˜s fast growing academic environments where there is a need to manage and maintain data over a long period of time. BITRI has embarked in a journey to develop a multi-domain (Primary, Junior and High Schools network based school management system aimed at computerizing school records and providing a convenient platform for administrators and teachers to access and manipulate school and student records, thus improving service delivery in an academic environment. 

The system will also provide a platform which facilitates staff-to-staff and teacher-to-parent communication where teachers can share student reports and send emails concerning students performance and disciplinary records.
